## About me

I'm working as a Back-end Developer at Brisanet Telecomunicações since January 2021. Using Perl, PostegreSQL database and tools such as Docker and Git. Keeping a legacy system.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems from the IFCE - Cedro.

Acted as an IT Equipment Maintenance Technique area at A. H. Araujo Filho, Automation from January 2019 to January 2021. Also working as a developer with experience in Delphi 2010, SQL Server 2016, project standards and code versioning.

My biggest hobby is looking for new challenges! The last adventures I joined were along with Go, Python and science and data processing.
